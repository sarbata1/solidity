# Solidity for JetBrains

A light, stable, and feature-rich Solidity language support plugin for JetBrains IDEs.

## Features
- Recognizes `.sol` files as Solidity source files in your JetBrains IDE.
- **Syntax highlighting** for Solidity keywords, types, comments, strings, and numbers.
- **Solidity file icon** for `.sol` files.
- **Code completion** for Solidity keywords, types, and smart contract constructs.
- **Structure view** for easy navigation of contracts, functions, and variables.
- **Code folding** for contracts, functions, and code blocks.
- **Error checking and linting** with real-time feedback as you type.
- **Run/Compile Solidity** contracts directly from the IDE with integrated output.
- **Deploy contracts** to Ethereum-compatible networks from within the IDE.
- **Go to definition, find usages, and code navigation** for Solidity symbols.
- **Quick documentation and parameter info** for Solidity elements.

## Usage
- Open or create any file with the `.sol` extension. The IDE will recognize it as a Solidity file and provide all advanced language features automatically.
